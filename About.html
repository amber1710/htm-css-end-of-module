    <h1>Onika Tanya Maraj fragrances</h1>

    <p><b>Tanya Maraj, known as Nicki Minaj, is American rapper and pop star, based in New York and born in Trinidad. Minaj trained as an actress before she released three mix tapes between 2007 and 2009 and signed to Young Money Entertainment. Her debut album, Pink Friday was released in November 2010 and quickly became a commercial success.</b></p>

    <p><b>rapper has unveiled the new ‘Queen' eau de parfum on nickiminajfragrance.com, in honor of her platinum-selling album.</b></p>

    <p><b>The scent, which is launching in partnership with the beauty distributor Luxe brands, was inspired by the multi-platinum recording artist's "bold and unapologetic approach to life." It features top notes of Asian Pear and Bergamot, a heart of Heliotrope and base notes of Tonka Bean, Praline and Musk for a smooth finish. It comes packaged in a vial representing Minaj's head and torso, complete with a gem-encrusted headpiece that can be detached and worn as a bracelet.</b></p>

    <p><b>Minaj already has plenty of experience in the fragrance business via her prior collaborations with Elizabeth Arden, and boasts a portfolio of scents including the floral "Pink Friday," a fruity signature fragrance dubbed "The Pinkprint" and a bold, berry blend titled "Minajesty." The star has also dabbled in the cosmetics industry recently, launching two lipsticks with beauty giant MAC in 2017, and the fashion business, having unveiled her collection for Diesel last fall.</b></p>

    <p><b>fragrances have undergone a major revival over the past few years, thanks to a handful of female stars currently dominating the market, including Ariana Grande, Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton.</b></p>

    <p><b>Minaj first alluded to Pink Friday in her verse on Drake's "Make Me Proud" in 2011, rapping, "It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too/ apparel I'm dominating in every avenue". Minaj and Give Back Brands worked on the fragrance throughout 2011 and early 2012, from an interview with BET Minaj stated "I like scents that feel summery, but have a va-va-voom I want to smell like a sexy and confident woman, not like candy". Speaking of the development of the fragrance Minaj is quoted saying:

        Pink Friday is a celebration of my life at this moment; it is a reflection of me as a creator, and an expression of me as a woman. I know my Barbz will connect with and appreciate each aspect – from the name, to the outrageous bottle design, to the vibrant colors that create their own song. Pink Friday shows off my personality and style; it's exciting to express my voice through another dimension...I was involved in every aspect of the decision-making process – it seems easy because I always get this feeling inside: I know if something is right or wrong. Each detail needs to 'wow' me or it is not an option; that's my way of composing perfection."</b></p>
